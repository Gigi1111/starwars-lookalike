Main-Idea: Using Star Wars API to create a single page website

Link: https://gigi1111.github.io/starwars-lookalike/

(trouble shooting: if you can't run it on Chrome, press Ctrl+Shift+R, or view it in incognito mode)

### Tools Used

API:
Star Wars API : SWAPI
https://swapi.co/


Image Hosting:
https://imgbb.com

Troubles
There can be some spelling and value assignment(eg. female characters being assigned a male value like Lama Su) errors from the SWAPI.

Warning
ImgBB will delete images not viewd for 6 months possibly.
